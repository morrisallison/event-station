# Performance Overview

*Updated 10/24/2015*

An overview of the performance of Event-Station compared to other event emitters; benchmarks included.

## Conclusion / TL;DR

* Event-Station ...
    - is a good choice when its versatile API is taken advantage of.
    - serves well as a standalone alternative to Backbone.Events.
    - has consistent performance. This is especially true when compared to EventEmitter2.
    - can be configured to increase performance. Configuration can be set globally or per instance.
* Projects that will only utilize basic features would be better served by other solutions.

## Benchmarks

The results below were from [benchmarks](https://github.com/morrisallison/event-station/blob/main/benchmarks/) run on Node.js v4.2.1 using the following modules:

* EventEmitter &mdash; `v4.2.1`
* EventEmitter2 &mdash; `v0.4.14`
* EventEmitter3 &mdash; `v1.1.1`
* Event-Station &mdash; `v1.0.0-beta`
* Backbone.Events &mdash; `v1.2.3`

***Event-Station (2)***

Event-Station (2) is using the `removeFrom()` listener modifier. Delimiters, RegExp listeners, and `all` events disabled.

***Event-Station (3)***

Event-Station (3) is using pre-built listeners, and the `attach()` &amp; `detach()` listener modifiers. Delimiters, RegExp listeners, and `all` events disabled.
