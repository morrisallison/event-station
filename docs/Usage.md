## Terminology

- `student` and `teacher` are used as examples of `EventStation` instances.

## Configuration

Event-Station can be configured globally using the `config()` static method.

```javascript
EventStation.config(options);
```

`EventStation` instances can configured during initialization by giving the constructor an object of options.

```javascript
new EventStation(options);
```

### Options

#### emitAllEvent

Determines whether an emitter emits an `"all"` event for every event that is emitted.

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  |

#### enableRegExp

Determines whether an emitter can use regular expression listeners.

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `false` |

#### regExpMarker

The character used to mark regular expression listeners.

| Type     | Default |

| `string` | `"%"`   |

#### enableDelimiter

Determines whether an emitter can use delimited event names.

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  |

#### delimiter

The character used to delimit event names in a string.

| Type     | Default       |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `string` | `" "` (space) |

### Reset

Global configuration can be reset without affecting existing stations by invoking `EventStation.reset();`

_**Note:** Invoking the global reset also resets injected dependencies._

## Listeners

Each listener is an object with its own state. As a result, listeners can maintain their state while being paused or detached from emitters.

Listener methods on the `EventStation` class share the same basic interface, which accepts:

- A `string` with a single event

```javascript
"foo";
```

- A `string` of delimited events

```javascript
"foo bar";
```

- An `Array` of `string` events

```javascript
["foo", "bar"];
```

- A listener map with events as keys and callbacks as properties

```javascript
{
    foo: function () {},
    bar: function () {},
}
```

### Single Event

A single event can be given to create one listener for one event.

```javascript
let listeners = student.on("wakeup", function () {
  console.error("No, five more minutes, please.");
});
```

### Delimited Event

Delimited events can be given to create multiple listeners with the same callback and/or context.

By default, events are delimited by spaces. This can be changed by setting the [`delimiter`](#delimiter) option.

```javascript
let listeners = student.on("eating-breakfast taking-shower", function () {
  console.warn("I'm running late!");
});
```

### Event Array

An array of events can be given to create multiple listeners with the same callback and/or context.

Delimiters are ignored in event arrays.

```javascript
let listeners = student.on(["need more", "sleep"], function () {
  console.warn("I'm really late!");
});
```

### Listener Map

A listener map can be given to create multiple listeners, each with a different callback.
Optionally, a shared context can also be given.

_**Note:** Delimiters are ignored in listener maps._

```javascript
let listeners = student.on({
  forgotHomework: function () {
    console.error("I'm in trouble.");
  },
  "forgot-books": function () {
    console.error("This is bad.");
  },
});
```

## Attaching Listeners

Listeners can be added via the `on()`, `once()`, `hear()`, and `hearOnce()` methods.

The `addTo()` and `moveTo()` listener modifiers can also be used to add listeners to an emitter.

```javascript
student.on("read", function () {
  console.log("The student is reading.");
});

let listeners = student.hear(teacher, "lecture", function () {
  console.log("Someone is lecturing.");
});

// The same listener is now listening for 'lecture' events by both the student and teacher.
listeners.addTo(student);
```

## Removing Listeners

Listeners can be removed via the `off()` and `disregard()` methods.

The `removeFrom()` and `moveTo()` listener modifiers can also be used to remove listeners from an emitter.

The `off()` listener modifier will remove the collection of listeners from _all_ emitters.

```javascript
// Removes all listeners from the teacher
// that were attached by the student
student.disregard(teacher);

// Remove all listeners from the emitter
student.off();

// Removes only the listeners that match the callback and context
student.off("study", studyCallback, studyContext);
```

```javascript
let listeners = student.on("read", function () {
  console.log("The student is reading.");
});

// Removes the listener from all emitters, including the `student`
listeners.off();
```

## Asynchronous Listeners

An asynchronous listener has a callback that returns a `Promise` compatible object.

Examples of asynchronous listeners:

```javascript
emitter.on("foo", function () {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      resolve();
    }, 2000);
  });
});

emitter.on("bar", function () {
  return Promise.reject();
});
```

The `emit()` method doesn't recognize asynchronous listeners, and will simply iterate over them as per normal.
The `emitAsync()` method will capture the returned promises, and return a new promise that will resolve,
when all of the captured promises have resolved.

```javascript
await emitter.emitAsync(["foo", "bar"]);

console.log('All "foo" and "bar" listeners have completed.');
```

_See the [Asynchronous Listeners](./Examples.md#asynchronous-listeners) example._

To clarify, both synchronous and asynchronous listeners can be attached to an emitter, listening to the same event,
and invoked with either `emit()` or `emitAsync()`. However, only `emitAsync()` will handle promises.

In short, `emitAsync()` should be used whenever you want to make sure, that all invoked listeners have finished handling an event.

## Emitting Events

Events are emitted via an emitter's `emit()` or `emitAsync()` methods.

The first argument can be an event string, a string of delimited events, or an array of events.

All arguments after the first are passed to each listener's callback function.

```javascript
teacher.on("lecture", function (bookTitle, pageNumber) {
  // We're reading page 741 in History 101.
  console.log(`We're reading page ${pageNumber} in ${bookTitle}.`);
});

teacher.emit("lecture", "History 101", 741);
```

## Providing Context

Context can be provided as the last argument on methods that attach listeners.

The `using()` listener modifier can be used to change the context of listeners.

```javascript
let context = new Date();

let listeners = student.on(
  "wakeup",
  function () {
    this.getFullYear();
  },
  context
);

listeners.using(new Date());
```

## Cross-emitter Listening

Cross-emitter listening is handled via the `hear()`, `hearOnce()`, and `disregard()` methods.

In the following example, the `student` emitter attaches a listener to the `teacher` emitter.
The listener will "remember" that is was attached by the `student` method.

```javascript
student.hear(teacher, "lecture", function (bookTitle, pageNumber) {
  student.sleep();
});
```

After the listener is attached, it can be removed via the `disregard()` method.

The following example removes all listeners from the `teacher` that were attached by the `student`.

```javascript
student.disregard(teacher);
```

## Limiting Occurrences

The number of times a listener's callback is invoked can be limited.

Occurrences can be limited via the `occur()` and `once()` listener modifiers, or the `once()` and `hearOnce()` methods.

When a listener reaches its occurrence limit, it will be removed from all emitters which it's attached to.

```javascript
student.once("talk", function () {});

student.on("talk", function () {}).occur(5);

student.hearOnce(teacher, "lecture");

student.hear(teacher, "lecture").once(function () {});
```

## Regular Expression Listeners

Regular expression (RegExp) listeners are disabled by default for improved performance.
RegExp listeners can be enabled globally or per emitter by setting the [`enableRegExp`](#enableRegExp) option.

When enabled, RegExp listeners are recognized by a marker. The marker is a single character located at the beginning of an event.

The RegExp marker is `"%"` by default and can be changed by setting the [`regExpMarker`](#regExpMarker) option.

```javascript
emitter.on("%foo/bar/[^/]+/1", callback);
```

Aside from the marker, the general interface remains unchanged.
In the following code, both a RegExp listener and a normal listener, will be attached to the emitter.

```javascript
emitter.on(["%foo/bar/[^/]+/1", "hello-world"], callback);
```

## Listener Modifiers

Listener modifiers are located on the `EventStation.Listeners` class and provide a fluent interface for modifying Listeners.

A `Listeners` instance can be created via the `on()`, `once()`, `hear()`, `hearOnce()`, `makeListeners()`, and `getListeners()` methods.

Please refer to the [module definition](https://github.com/morrisallison/event-station/blob/main/dist/event-station.d.ts) for details on each modifier.

## Browser Usage

Event-Station can be used in Web browsers that support ES5.

Please view the section on [installation](../README.md#installation) for how to load Event-Station in a Web browser.

If Event-Station is loaded via a `<script>` tag, an `EventStation` global will be assigned.

## Inheritance

The `EventStation` class can be extended directly.

#### ES6

```javascript
class Teacher extends EventStation {}

/* true */ new Teacher() instanceof EventStation;
```
